This is a test post. I think the strategy is to use Collections to group posts of the same type together. I can try to do this by category I think. For now, I'm going to just have a page with the Categories, then a giant list of posts by each category.

### Gran Turismo
Uplifting movie with a bit of cheese ("No, Dad, you DON'T understand!"). We saw it in 4DX, which was fun.
